# Voyant Dogfinder by Mitchell Stewart

## Introduction

Thank you for taking the time to look at my project. If you have any questions or critiques please let me know. I had a lot of fun with this project and used it as an oppurtunity to learn Tailwind which sped up the development process considerably in the design phase.

## Build steps

If you want to run this locally on your own machine
After cloning and cd'ing into the folder

1. `npm i`
2. `npm run start`
3. Go to the port specified, usually `localhost:3000`

## Next Steps

If more time is spent on this project these are the changes I would make going forward in order.

1. Add tests using Jest and Cypress
2. Refactor components to use Context instead of props. Perhaps a simple state machine or redux if the project grew in complexity
3. Refactor Add/Edit Breed and Size to dropdowns
4. Add user authentication
5. Store data in firebase
6. Allow photo upload of dog, or have default Dog icon if none provided
